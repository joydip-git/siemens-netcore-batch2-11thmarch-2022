create an application to calculate area of different shapes
Circle
	data - radius
	method - CalculateArea
			args: NA
			return type: double

triangle
	data - tbase, theight
	method - CalculateArea
			args: NA
			return type: double


create objects of both circle and triangle  (at least one each)
store them in a collection
iterate through them again and print the calculated area of every shape
